Since a few people asked me if they can have PicasaWeb based image gallery on their website, I decided to convert my bbcode generator into image gallery and wrote little tutorial that is posted on net.tutsplus.com.
Compatibility

This tool was tested to work only with Firefox 3.0.0, Google Chrome 0.2, and IE 7.0. This web site has PHP version 5.2.6, therefore I cannot guaranty work on earlier versions. SimpleXML required.
Licence

Picasa Web To Web Site by Mikhail Kozlov is free to use and or modify in any way.
